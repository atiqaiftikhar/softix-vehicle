     <h2 class=" text-center">Selling a car made easy: everything you need to know</h2>
     <br>
     <p>The sale of your old used car is coming up and because a good amount of money is involved, nothing should go wrong. But very few people are experienced car salesmen or know everything about selling a car. Nowadays there are various ways to make money from a used car and there are a few things that need to be taken into account. We have put together a clear overview for you here of how best to proceed, what options are available to you for selling a car and what is important in each case.</p>
     <br>
     <h4>Where can I sell my car?</h4>
     <br>
     <p>If you want to sell your car, there are various options available today. In addition to the classic sales note in the car window, you as a seller have the best chance of success if you are also familiar with online sales. Here you can sell the car to a certified dealer or to a private interested party via an advertisement. The speed and reach of the ad are particularly noteworthy here, as is the advantage that you can create the sales ad from the comfort of your own home and usually completely free of charge.</p>
     <h4>Selling a car: privately or to a dealer?</h4>
     <br>
     <p>Ever-changing life situations and today's fast pace of life ultimately also affect our use of cars. Be it the growing family that no longer finds enough space in the small car, or perhaps the old diesel engine should be swapped for an electric vehicle? Maybe there is even a move coming up where you can't take the used car with you? – Depending on the situation, car owners have different time windows for selling used cars. Fittingly, there are various ways to sell your old car flexibly these days.</p>
     <h4>Sell ​​car to dealer</h4>
     <br>
     <p>If you want to make money from your old used car quickly and easily, you should contact a professional dealer. Car purchasing and brokerage portals such as mobile.de offer a corresponding online form to find a suitable, nearby purchase point and to make an appointment. On the agreed date, the car will be inspected carefully on site so that the real sales value can then be determined. Not only the condition of your own car is crucial, but also the general market value of this model. If the price is right, the car sale can be completed on the same day, so that the money is in the account a short time later. So if you're in a hurry to sell and value the full security of selling a used car, you can sell your car to a dealer in this way - quickly, safely and easily.</p>
     <h4>Sell ​​car privately</h4>
     <br>
     <p>However, if you have a little more time and patience and want to sell the car privately , you can advertise the old used car yourself. The biggest advantage of this option is that the seller sets the selling price and conditions himself. There is also a better chance of selling the used car at a higher price. On used car portals like mobile.de you can easily create a free advertisement and reach up to 14 million potential buyers. You can also offer your car for sale on social networks, for example in suitable Facebook groups. With a bit of luck, you can even find the right buyer in your own neighborhood. All you need to do is leave a message on bulletin boards or post it directly in your car to make passers-by aware of the sale of your car. It is important that you provide an email and/or telephone number and that you can always be reached. Afterwards you have to take care of the numerous inquiries, viewing appointments and test drives, which can sometimes be very nerve-wracking. We have put together the best way to do this and what you should pay attention to in this article: “Selling your car privately – this is how it works”</p>
     <h4>When should I sell my car?</h4>
     <br>
     <p>In addition to various personal reasons, the timing can also be an important factor in selling your car. The loss in value of a car increases with every year, smaller and larger repairs pile up sooner or later and offers of new cars are on every corner. Especially in the case of repairs, it must be considered whether it is still economically worthwhile to keep the car. In general, one can say: If the costs for upcoming repairs are more than half of the residual value, it makes more financial sense to sell the car. Of course, the car should still be in a roadworthy condition. Minor repairs and an inspection visit usually have a significantly positive effect on the sales value, so you should plan for this before selling. Even if the value of the vehicle is no longer particularly high, a new TÜV seal can bring a price difference of up to €2,000.

     <h4 >How do I sell my car?</h4>
     <p>Regardless of whether you want to sell your car privately or to a dealer, there are a few things to consider in each case. Using the following list, you can easily proceed step by step so as not to forget any important point.</p>
     <h4>Get information and set a price</h4>
     <p>If you are well prepared, you can also appear confident in sales discussions. The most important factor is the price of the used car. If this is set too high, potential buyers will be put off and you will not receive any inquiries. If the price is too low, the phone will probably ring continuously and you won't make any real profit in the end. To find out the exact residual value of your car, you can have a report issued by TÜV, DEKRA or Schwacke. However, since this involves certain costs, you can alternatively simply do your own research and get an idea of ​​the current market situation. On mobile.de you have the opportunity to enter all the data about your used car such as make, model, equipment, registration, etc. into a search mask and then receive a real sales value. It's also worth taking a look at other sellers' advertisements so that you can get a certain feel for how much you can charge for your car. Most sellers initially set the amount higher in order to retain a certain amount of leeway at their own desired price.

     </p>
     <h4>2. Car care and preparation</h4>
     <p>First of all, a used car should have no major defects and be in a roadworthy condition. The trip to the general inspection is therefore inevitable and should ideally be planned shortly before the sale. It can be worthwhile to have minor scratches, dents and paint damage repaired, as a well-kept appearance is positive and usually leaves a good overall impression on the buyer. Thorough cleaning of the car (outside and inside) also pays off. A used car is of course not a new car, but the more you can give the impression of it, the better the chances of selling it and you can achieve a higher selling price. If you want to create an online advertisement, you should also take care of attractive images . On the one hand, the car should be shown from its best side, but any defects must also be clearly recorded.</p>
     <h4>3.a Create an advertisement for private sales</h4>
     <p>If the car is in top condition both visually and technically and has been captured in pictures, then you can continue with the advertisement on used car portals such as mobile.de. If you want to be successful when selling used cars, you should be particularly careful to describe the condition in which the car is. This means that all important details should be stated truthfully and special equipment such as electronic parking assistance, cruise control, Apple Carplay, etc. should be explicitly highlighted. Existing defects should be communicated honestly and documented with appropriate pictures. This not only ensures transparency, but also creates a certain level of trust before the meeting so that interested parties know exactly where they stand. In addition, there will be no unpleasant surprises or disappointments afterwards. Finally, an option for the price must be selected. The decision between a negotiated basis and a fixed price rests solely with you, but room for negotiation leaves a feeling of say on the part of the buyer.</p>
     <h4>3.b Find a suitable dealer</h4>
     <p>If you want to sell your car to a dealer or a purchasing point, the vehicle will be inspected by them at an agreed appointment. So you don't have to worry about suitable pictures or advertisement descriptions, but the thorough cleaning will benefit you here too. A well-maintained car also leaves a better impression on a dealer and can have a positive effect on the residual value estimate. On mobile.de you can easily search for a suitable dealer in your area and make an appointment directly.</p>
     <h4>Necessary documents</h4>
     <p>So that nothing can go wrong on the day of the sale, all documents should be collected in advance and ready to hand. This includes, on the one hand, the vehicle keys, registration certificate parts I and II (vehicle license and vehicle registration document) as well as the inspection certificate and the service booklet. Documents regarding maintenance and repair work, warranty certificates, and any acceptance and registration papers regarding changes to the car should also be brought with you to the handover. When making a sale with a private buyer, a verified sample contract form for both parties should not be missing.</p>
     <h4>5. Test drive and purchase contract</h4>
     <p>Before a prospective buyer decides to buy, the important test drive takes place. The potential new owner gets a precise feeling of how the car drives and feels. There are several things to consider here. First, you should check with your insurance company whether another driver is allowed to drive your car. If the car has already been deregistered, you will also have to take care of a short-term license plate or a so-called red number. Basically, you should have the interested party's ID and driver's license shown to you before you start your journey. And the golden rule for all test drives is: always ride in the car yourself. If everything has gone well and both parties can agree on a price, then the purchase can be sealed by signing a contract. Both the buyer and the seller should provide all data carefully.</p>
     <h4>Inform the relevant authorities</h4>
     <p>After the sale, the responsible registration office and the vehicle insurance company must be informed about the purchase or sale of the vehicle. It also makes sense to have the buyer record the re-registration contractually so that you don't have to continue paying taxes on the car that has already been sold. If you sell your car to a dealer, they will also take care of deregistering the vehicle.</p>
