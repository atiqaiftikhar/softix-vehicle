            <p>Every car owner knows what price he paid for his car. But hardly anyone knows how much the vehicle will be worth a few years later. How did the price develop for the model? How high is the demand? Car owners who want to sell their old car can find out all this in just a few minutes: with our professional and free car valuation.<br>

                How does the vehicle valuation work? How do we calculate the price? First of all, you have to enter your car’s data online into our tool. The relevant information for our car valuation includes: make, model, first registration and vehicle key number. All of this is on the vehicle registration document under point 2.1 (for the manufacturer) and point 2.2 (for the type). Entering the data into our valuation only takes a few minutes. Then we need your email address and your zip code. As Germany's largest vehicle market, we then evaluate your car free of charge using our comprehensive database and calculate a statistical price online. This way you can find out in no time how much your used car is worth. Fast, reliable and free.</p>

                        <p>If you want to sell your car, you need to know how much the vehicle is worth. The easiest way to determine this is to get a professional car valuation. In contrast to buying a new car, a price must be set when selling an old car. And it should be neither too high nor too low. Because if the vehicle owner asks for too little, he is wasting money. If he charges too high a price, the email inbox will remain empty. It is therefore advisable to have the statistical price for the model calculated using our online valuation before selling your used car.<br>
                            Have you inherited an old car that you don't want to keep? Don't know how much this car is worth? Then use our car valuation. Our reputable vehicle valuation works with a variety of data sets and compares the prices of numerous similar cars.</p>

<p> This is how we can calculate the statistical car value online. And you can sell your used car stress-free and easily - at a fair price.
    <br>Have you unexpectedly become a Hartz IV recipient and would like to know what is happening to your car? No worries. Hartz IV recipients do not necessarily have to sell their car. In principle, they are allowed to own a vehicle. The individual case assessment decides whether these are usable assets or protective assets. If the car is considered appropriate, it counts as part of the savings assets and may not be counted towards the Hartz IV standard benefit. Roughly speaking, a car that is worth a maximum of 7,500 euros is considered appropriate. You usually have to sell models that are worth more. You can have your model evaluated free of charge using our online calculator.

                        <p>We calculate the value of a used car using our database. Our method works online and is based on statistics: Based on used car data from more than a hundred thousand types and models in different regions, we use our car valuation to calculate the statistical value of an old vehicle. Fast, reliable, free.<br>
                            The price determined by the vehicle valuation is a guide. Not every used car seller provides all the data. Not every owner knows the special features of their used car and how valuable these can be when valuing the car and selling it. There are also local differences. In Munich the price for the same car is sometimes significantly higher than in Leipzig.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>If you compare the price of our car valuation with a dealer's offer, you should know that a dealer can look at the car and evaluate its condition. Our vehicle valuation does not know the individual condition of your car. Is the exhaust rusted? Or is it particularly well maintained? Does the car have dents? Or expensive special equipment? All of this affects the car value. The dealer or vehicle appraiser can look at the car at their leisure and everything will be taken into account. Our used car valuation doesn't do that. Special models and other special features can also be a cause for price variations.<br>
                        So remember: The car value we provide online is a guide. The local dealer will take a close look at your car and talk to you in detail about the vehicle rating and the individual condition of the model. He will then make you an offer and you can sell your used vehicle directly.</p>

            <p>To ensure you get the best price for your used car, you should take a close look at your car and then clean it thoroughly. Because a well-maintained and clean car achieves a higher selling price.<br>When well cared for, your vehicle looks nicer. Therefore, vacuum the interior and remove personal items and garbage. Position the ventilation flaps in one direction. A clean trunk and engine compartment make a better impression. You vacuum away leaves and dirt between the drainage channels. If this is too complicated for you, you can hire a professional vehicle detailer. You usually get the money you invest back through a higher sales price.

        </div>
        <p>After cleaning, you can take photos of your car directly. Advertisements with beautiful car photos are clicked more often and increase sales opportunities. The advertisement must make you want to see the vehicle live and in color. A shot from the front is recommended as the lead photo for the ad. It looks particularly good when the photographer crouches down and all four wheels are visible. You should then describe the model in the advertisement as precisely as possible, including features, maintenance, investments, repairs and accessories.</p>

        <p>You should take a close look at your car before selling it. How is the condition? Should it be put into shape before selling? Intensive polishing or smart repair helps with minor paint damage. Small scratches, dents or dents are removed by professionals. The work usually costs a few hundred euros. The investments are usually recouped when the used car is sold. Value-preserving repairs and small investments are also worthwhile so that the car remains roadworthy. A fresh sticker from the general inspection (HU) significantly increases the value of the vehicle.<br>
            For major repairs, a free car valuation should be carried out online beforehand. If the repair costs more than the car is worth, it's not worth it. The vehicle is damaged? Then the liability insurance of the other party in the accident may pay.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Then you can have the money paid out by the insurance company and invest in a new car. This is the best solution in the event of a total economic loss.

        <p>
            When determining the value of a car, it must be taken into account that there are different types of value. Our car valuation works with the help of constantly updated market value monitoring with more than 1.4 million vehicles. This is how we determine realistic vehicle values ​​and calculate a supra-regional market value for all vehicles.<br>
            When it comes to car valuation, there are other options and terms that need to be taken into account. The current value, for example, describes the value of the used item at a specified point in time. The replacement value is the price you would have to pay if you were to buy the same car again. The replacement value may differ from the market value.
            <br>
            The purchase price indicates the price that a dealer would pay. The price is also often called the purchase price. It is usually lower than the selling price because the dealer ultimately wants to make money from the sale. The list value is the price that the car costs according to the list. This can be the new price list or the used car list from Schwacke or other providers.

            mobile.de's sophisticated valuation matrix calculates the current market value of a used car. Based on around 1.4 million vehicles, we calculate a daily, free car valuation in seconds and give you a fair price for your car.

            But there are other methods to create a used car valuation. The oldest basis is a list from Schwacke. Since 1957, it has been providing the approximate residual value of used vehicles based on vehicle type, year of manufacture, equipment and mileage. The DAT list also regularly determines the values ​​of used vehicles as a basis for dealer purchases.<br>
           Individual car dealerships also offer a dealer appraisal to determine the value of the car. The basis for the evaluation is often lists from Schwacke or DAT.

    <p>
        Car clubs such as the ADAC also prepare a used car check report for a fee, and the work is carried out in one of the nationwide testing centers. Official testing institutes such as TÜV, Dekra or GTÜ also prepare used car reports for a fee. There are also a number of freelance experts who also prepare reports or valuation reports for a fee. Depending on the scope, this includes a fresh general inspection, a technical and visual check and a paint layer thickness measurement.
